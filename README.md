# Analysis-of-an-unsusual-news-website

I write research articles for econewstoday.com (spanish website). That is why I wanted to an analyisis of the most engaging pages based on user behavior and semantic analysis of the 157 articles written until November 2021.  

There were 4 performance groups (Clusters) and 5 Dominant topics (Pollution, Economy, Climate crisis, Products and Consumption).

The results showed that the most engaging pages are not the ones that have the most amount of pageviews (18% returning visitors & 33% bounced rate). The best section is Lifestyle (texts with 2.310 average characters length) and the best dominant topics are Economy and Products (best keywords: change, water).
